# DataTables_from_ClojureScript_in_DevCards_PlayGround

This example shows how to use Datatables.net tables from ClojureScript.  It just uses normal JQuery and is only a simple example with two rows of data. The Datatable is configured with the data and the columns in the ClojureScript code.  From this example you should be able to move on and use Datatables with ClojureScript for other things and use it's API fairly easily.
